I first subscribed to this sub-reddit when we had about 15,000 people. I've seen this sub grow from a small self-contained 
community into what it is today. There has been numerous posts about how the quality of the sub has gone down with time.
I'm not here to post about that, rather I'm here to talk about numbers.
So, I was bored some time last week and quickly wrote up a crawler to analyse /r/India over the past year. Here are the results. 

Disclaimer - Results aren't *that* precise. Don't hold me to the 5^th decimal of precision. But it's fairly accurate overall. 

Total No. of posts - 68283
First post - 22-Aug-2014 11:56:45
Last post - 22-Aug-2015 06:19:42
Avg/day ~ 187

Submissions. 
This is the distribution for political, non-political and misc posts.
Distribution for self-posts vs links.

No. of posts with score < 1 - 10164 , which is 15% of all posts.
No. of posts with score == 1 - 6079 , which is 8.9% of all posts.
No. of posts with score > 1 but < 100 - 48848 , which is 71.5% of all posts. 
No. of posts with score > 100 - 3192 , which is 4.6%.

Total number of comments in a year = 1056240 
Avg Comments in a day ~ 2893
Total score = 1444291 (I know, I know. This is super-useless data much like this whole analysis)

Average No. of comments/post = 15. Median score = 3.
Average Scores of posts = 21. Median score = 6.

Time for the important part, the people who make up this sub. The submitters.
8286 unique posters.
Top 5 submitters. 
/u/gcs8		2008	2.94%
/u/anveshj	1150	1.68%
/u/_dexter	1053	1.54%
/u/Tauji	893	1.30%
/u/drm_wvr	753	1.10%

Interesting profiles -

/u/Tom_JerryToon - Seems to post only links.

/u/madarchoda - Most links from www.dailypioneer.com. First time I'm hearing of such a website!
So I checked out how many times daily pioneer has been posted. Result was 264. And number of time /u/madarchoda has posted 
out of that 264 -> 215. Also I think he has an alt /u/maadcho. 

/u/yellowpage09, seems to post a lot of links from econotimes.com. And every time samacharbot comments, he deletes it. Hm. He also
posts links from bbc.co.uk and stuff and never asks samacharbot to delete its post. HM. 

Political posts.
2651 unique posters.
1361 posters have posted only once (50%).
Top 4 submitters remain the same.

DailyMail = 187.
NYTimes = 165.
WP = 55.

Finally, I did some sentimental analysis on the submission titles. 

Here is the pie-chart of the distribution. 

So I took a look at the negative posts and 77.64% of the posts had at least one comment and 85% of the posts had a score greater than 0. Also 67% of posts had 
a score more than '0' and at least '1' comment. 14 comments on average. 21 points on average. 

In the positive posts, 68% of posts had a score more than '0' and at least '1' comment. 75% had at least one comment and 85% of had a score greater than '0'.
14 comments on avg. 21 points on average.

In the case of neutral posts 85% of had a score greater than '0', 80% had at least '1' comment and 69% had a score more than '0' and at least '1' comment.
21 points on average. 17 comments on average. 

So /r/India doesn't care if it's a positive/negative or neutral post. They seem to comment in and upvote whatever they find interesting.

There is obviously a lot more that can be done. In case you want some quick query done, leave a comment, I'll get back to you ASAP.

And oh, I used Python 3.4 + PRAW for getting the submissions. And MATLAB R2015b for analysis. 

Also, I'm yet to analyze the comments. Yes, I have all of the comments too. I'll do that soon, working on something else at the moment. 
Leave a comment if you want to see some queries done on the comments.
